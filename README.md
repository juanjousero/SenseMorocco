# SenseMorocco

Welcome to SENSE, interactive web page designed by José Omar Fernández with Figma, a great friend of mine, and developed by myself with HTML, CSS and Javascript.

I encourage you to play with the final Morocco map, which I have enjoyed more.

This design is only avaible for laptops and 21" screens for now, but it will be responsive in the future.

I hope you like it and any feedback is welcomed!
